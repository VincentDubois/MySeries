To combat these vile beasts, ordinary people received superhuman powers and became known as &quot;Hunters.&quot; Twenty-year-old Sung Jin-Woo is one such Hunter, but he is known as the &quot;World&apos;s Weakest,&quot; owing to his pathetic power compared to even a measly E-Rank. Still, he hunts monsters tirelessly in low-rank Gates to pay for his mother&apos;s medical bills.<br /><br />However, this miserable lifestyle changes when Jin-Woo—believing himself to be the only one left to die in a mission gone terribly wrong—awakens in a hospital three days later to find a mysterious screen floating in front of him. This &quot;Quest Log&quot; demands that Jin-Woo completes an unrealistic and intense training program, or face an appropriate penalty. Initially reluctant to comply because of the quest&apos;s rigor, Jin-Woo soon finds that it may just transform him into one of the world&apos;s most fearsome Hunters.</p>","Japanese",7.9,"Running","2024-01-06","https://www.tvmaze.com/shows/64632/solo-leveling","https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/497/1244908.jpg"),

Because she is an elf, she is able to live over a thousand years. She promises Himmel and the others that she will be back to see them and then sets out on a journey by herself. Fifty years later, Frieren goes to visit Himmel and the others. She remained unchanged, but Himmel and the others have aged and only a little of their lives remain. Later, she witnesses Himmel&apos;s death. Frieren is pained by her desire to have spent more time getting to know people. With that regret in her heart, she then goes on a journey to do just that. On her journey, she meets many people and many events await her.</p>","Japanese",8.1,"Running","2023-09-29","https://www.tvmaze.com/shows/69956/frieren-beyond-journeys-end","https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/479/1198409.jpg");
